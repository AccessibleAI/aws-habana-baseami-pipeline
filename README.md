## AWS Habana Gaudi DL1 Base AMI Build Pipeline
To facilitate getting started with the Habana Gaudi DL1 instances. We have included some sample build scripts based on Packer to build base AL2, Ubuntu18.04, as well as ECS and EKS base AMIs. Included are sample buildspecs which you integrate with a CodeBuild/CodePipeline for automatic builds.

## Packer Instructions
In the `gaudi-ami_base` dir you will find packer scripts for Amazon Linux 2 and Ubuntu 18.04. Generally you just need to modify the `variables:{}` json and execute the packer build
````json
  "variables": {
    "region": "us-west-2",
    "flag": "ul18-base",
    "subnet_id": "subnet-4532e73d",
    "security_groupids": "sg-092c73af8b33e6bab",
    "build_ami": "ami-090717c950a5c34d3",
    "habanalabs-driver-version": "1.0.1-81"
  },
````  
After filling in the `variables` check that the packer script is validated.
````
packer validate habana-dl1-al2.yml
packer build habana-vt-al2.yml
````
